Designing and implementing data warehouse using ETL,SQL ,Python,Azure and power BI

Welcome to the ** Data Warehouse and Analytics Project ** built using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern, scalable data pipeline using layered data processing principles. It's ideal for handling large-scale analytics and transforming raw data into actionable insights.

**Project Overview:**

üîç What is the Medallion Architecture?
The Medallion Architecture is a data design pattern that organizes data into three logical layers:

ü•â Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw, ingested data stored as-is from source systems.

ü•à Silver Layer ‚Äì Cleaned and transformed data with applied business logic.

ü•á Gold Layer ‚Äì Aggregated, refined data optimized for reporting and analytics.

### By structuring data this way, we achieve: Clear separation of raw and processed data , Easier debugging and data lineage tracing Scalable, modular pipelines for real-time or batch processing

## Project Objective :To build a scalable and modular data warehouse for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and analytics.

This project involves:

**Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

**ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

**Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

**Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

#### Projects Requirements 

**Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

**Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

**Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

**Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

**Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
Objective Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

1.**Customer Behavior**
2.**Product Performance**
3.**Sales Trends**
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
